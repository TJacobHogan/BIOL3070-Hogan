## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r scatterplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

# Read in the data
copd <- read_csv("copd_2021.csv")

# Remove the national total
copd <- copd %>% filter(State != "United States")

# Create scatterplot: Female vs. Male COPD prevalence
ggplot(copd, aes(x = Male_Percent, y = Female_Percent, 
                 size = Total_Percent, color = Total_Percent, label = State)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = State), hjust = 1.2, vjust = 0.5, size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_color_viridis(name = "Total COPD (%)", option = "C", direction = -1) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Total COPD (%)") +
  labs(
    title = "COPD Prevalence by State: Male vs. Female (2021)",
    x = "Male COPD Prevalence (%)",
    y = "Female COPD Prevalence (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "right"
  )


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
